<h1>Display process of a static page</h1>

<p>
  The display process of a static page in Django involves the following steps:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Request: 
    When a user visits a URL in their browser, it sends a request to the Django server. 
    The request contains information such as the URL path, HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.), and any additional data like form inputs or query parameters.
  </li>
  <li>
    URL Routing: 
    Django's URL dispatcher receives the request and matches it to a specific URL pattern defined in your project's urls.py file. 
    This mapping determines which view function should handle the request.
  </li>
  <li>
    View Function: 
    The view function is a Python function that processes the request and generates a response. 
    It can perform various tasks such as fetching data from a database, processing form submissions, or rendering a template.
  </li>
  <li>
    Template Rendering: 
    In the view function, you can use Django's template engine to render a template. 
    Templates are HTML files with embedded Django template tags and variables. 
    These tags and variables allow you to dynamically generate content based on the data provided.
  </li>
  <li>
    Template Inheritance: 
    In your provided code, you have a template that includes a block content tag. 
    This tag defines a placeholder in the template where child templates can override and insert their content. 
    It allows for template inheritance, where you can have a base template with common elements and specific child templates that extend and customize the content.
  </li>
  <li>
    Response: 
    Once the template is rendered, the view function returns an HTTP response object. 
    This response object contains the rendered HTML content, along with any additional headers or status codes. 
    Django then sends this response back to the user's browser.
  </li>
  <li>
    Browser Display: 
    Finally, the user's browser receives the response and displays the static web page generated by the template. 
    The browser interprets the HTML, applies any CSS styles, and executes any JavaScript code included in the page.
  </li>
</ol>
